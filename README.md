Task 1: Landing Page
A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners, requiring basic knowledge of these languages. 
Through this project, I've learned to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. 
The most exciting part was unleashing my creativity to design an impressive and user-friendly page. I paid close attention to alignments, 
padding, the color palette, boxes, and other elements to ensure a polished look while avoiding overlapping elements with careful CSS management. ðŸ“©
